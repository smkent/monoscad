Gridfinity bins with lids (covers), reimplemented as a parametric model in [OpenSCAD][openscad]

## Description

I really like
[**mhejjas' Gridfinity 1 x 1 x 2 and 1 x 1 x 3 inserts with cover, divided in multiple ways**][original-model-url],
but I also wanted to make bins of arbitrary sizes.

This is a parametric reimplementation of the original model in OpenSCAD, using
[**Gridfinity Rebuilt in OpenSCAD** by **kennetek**][gridfinity-rebuilt-openscad]
for the core [Gridfinity][gridfinity] elements.

## Setup

See [the top-level README.md](/README.md) for libraries installation.

## Changes from upstream

- No holes by default
- Tab size
- Tab angle
- Bin height half unit increments
- Extra pocket depth
- [Stacking tabs by @rpedde](https://github.com/kennetek/gridfinity-rebuilt-openscad/pull/122)

## Differences of the remix compared to the original

This tweaks [Gridfinity Rebuilt in OpenSCAD][gridfinity-rebuilt-openscad] with
additional settings options and minor features.

This is a reimplementation of
