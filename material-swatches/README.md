[Material Swatches][original-model-url], rebuilt in OpenSCAD

![Animated example](images/readme/demo.gif)

# Description

Material Swatches are a handy reference for filament colors and materials! The
[original model][original-model-url] provides models for a handful of material
types, but is not customizable. This model is built from scratch in OpenSCAD,
which allows creation of swatches with arbitrary text.

Material Swatches also happen to be the perfect size to [store in Gridfinity
bins!][gridfinity-bins-material-swatches]

## Included remix by GetBurning

This model includes a tweaked version of [GetBurning's remix of this
model][getburning-remix] as `material-swatch-getburning-remix.scad`, which
supports adding three lines of arbitrary text onto the swatch instead of just
using the material name.

This remix uses the [Obitron font][orbitron-font] ([license][ofl]).

## Differences of the remix compared to the original
