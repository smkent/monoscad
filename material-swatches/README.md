# Description

Material Swatches are a handy reference for filament colors and materials! The
[original model][original-model-url] provides models for a handful of material
types, but is not customizable. This model is built from scratch in OpenSCAD,
which allows creation of swatches with arbitrary text.

Material Swatches also happen to be the perfect size to [store in Gridfinity
bins!][gridfinity-bins-material-swatches]
